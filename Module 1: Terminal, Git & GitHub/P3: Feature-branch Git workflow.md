# P3: Feature-branch Git workflow

This task shows how to work on a feature branch and merge it into the main branch.

## Objective
Create a new branch, add a feature, and merge it into `main`.

## Example workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature/about-page
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Add about section"
git checkout main
git merge feature/about-page
git push origin main
```

## Why this matters
Using a feature branch keeps changes organized and prevents direct editing of the main codebase.

## Result
The feature branch is merged safely into the main repository.
